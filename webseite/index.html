		<h2>Time to party! The Captcha Design Festival is taking place for the tenth time this year! </h2> <p>The festival is organized by a group of students from the University of Applied Sciences Mannheim each fall. Students from all over the world can register for the festival and attend our workshops the following days in order to broaden their horizons and gain a new perspective on design.

		<h2>This year's topic is vegetation.</h2>
		<p>With a focus on the worlds of plants at first, one will soon come to realise that vegetation can also be a means to describe a larger unit of diversity and the process of growth as a whole. To find out whether that be in the plant world, applied to us humans, the digital world or in a completely new sense is up to everyone individually.</p>

	<div class="ablauf">
		<p>As is tradition, our festival will commence with the symposium, a series of presentations by our wonderful guest designers, on Tuesday, the 5th. Afterwards, we will get to work in our variety of workshops over the span of three days, and finish with the vernissage on Saturday, the 9th of September 2023.</p>
